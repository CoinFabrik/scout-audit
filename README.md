Scout is an extensible open-source tool intended to assist Substrate developers and auditors detect common security issues and deviations from best practices.

This tool will help developers write secure and more robust Substrate pallets, runetime code and node code.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing, our usage of comparable tools, and the development of Scout for smart contracts in [Polkadot ink!](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout) and [other blockchains](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout).

To improve coverage and precision, weÂ´ll persist in research efforts on static and dynamic analysis techniques. Find more about our ongoing research at our associated repository.
