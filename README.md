Scout is an extensible open-source tool intended to assist [ink!](https://use.ink/smart-contracts-polkadot/) and [Soroboan](https://stellar.org/soroban) smart contract developers and auditors detect common security issues and deviations from best practices.

This tool will help developers write secure and more robust smart contracts.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing and our usage of comparable tools in other blockchains. To improve coverage and precision, weÂ´ll persist in research efforts on static and dynamic analysis techniques.

## Quick Start

For a quick start, make sure that Cargo is installed on your computer. Then, install Scout dependencies by running the following command:

`cargo +nightly install cargo-dylint dylint-link`

Afterwards, install Scout with the following command:

`cargo +nightly install cargo-scout-audit`

To run Scout, navigate to the root directory of any ink! or Soroban project and execute the following command:

`cargo scout-audit`

For more information on installation and usage, please refer to the Getting Started section in our documentation below and to the [Scout for ink!](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout) and [Scout for Soroban](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban) respositories.

## Tests

To validate our tool, we provide a set of code examples located in the test-cases folder.

In order to run the integration tests, navigate to apps/cargo-scout-audit and run:

`cargo test --all --all-features`

In order to run the tests for a particular test-case, run the same command on that particular test-case folder (e.g: test-cases/delegate-call/delegate-call-1/vulnerable-example).
