Scout is an extensible open-source tool intended to assist [ink!](https://use.ink/smart-contracts-polkadot/) and [Soroboan](https://stellar.org/soroban) smart contract developers and auditors detect common security issues and deviations from best practices.

This tool will help developers write secure and more robust smart contracts.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing and our usage of comparable tools in other blockchains. To improve coverage and precision, weÂ´ll persist in research efforts on static and dynamic analysis techniques.

## Quick Start

For a quick start, make sure that Cargo is installed on your computer. Then, install Scout dependencies by running the following command:

`cargo +nightly install cargo-dylint dylint-link`

Afterwards, install Scout with the following command:

`cargo +nightly install cargo-scout-audit`

To run Scout, navigate to the root directory of any ink! or Soroban project and execute the following command:

`cargo scout-audit`

For more information on Scout's installation and usage, please refer to Scout's documentation for [ink!](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout) or [Soroban](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban).

## Tests

To validate our tool, we provide a set of code examples located in the test-cases folder.

In order to run the integration tests, navigate to apps/cargo-scout-audit and run:

`cargo test --all --all-features`

In order to run the tests for a particular test-case, run the same command on that particular test-case folder (e.g: test-cases/delegate-call/delegate-call-1/vulnerable-example).

## Detectors

Detectors available for Scout are the ones available for Scout in its [ink!](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout?tab=readme-ov-file#detectors) and [Soroban](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban?tab=readme-ov-file#detectors) versions.                                                                                              

## Acknowledgements

Scout is an open source vulnerability analyzer developed by [CoinFabrik's](https://www.coinfabrik.com/) Research and Development team.

We received support through grants from both the [Web3 Foundation Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master), the [Aleph Zero Ecosystem Funding Program](https://alephzero.org/ecosystem-funding-program) and the [Stellar Community Fund](https://communityfund.stellar.org).

| Grant Program | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| ![Web3 Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinFabrik/scout/main/assets/web3-foundation.png) | **Proof of Concept:** We collaborated with the [Laboratory on Foundations and Tools for Software Engineering (LaFHIS)](https://lafhis.dc.uba.ar/) at the [University of Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/internacionales/index.php?lang=en) to establish analysis techniques and tools for our detectors, as well as to create an initial list of vulnerability classes and code examples. [View Grant](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/web3-grant) \| [Application Form](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/ScoutCoinFabrik.md).<br><br>**Prototype:** We built a functioning prototype using linting detectors built with [Dylint](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint) and expanded the list of vulnerability classes, detectors, and test cases. [View Prototype](https://coinfabrik.github.io/scout/) \| [Application Form](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/ScoutCoinFabrik_2.md). |
| ![Aleph Zero](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinFabrik/scout/main/assets/aleph-zero.png) | We improved the precision and number of detectors for the tool with a multi-phase approach. This included a manual vulnerability analysis of projects within the Aleph Zero ecosystem, comprehensive testing of the tool on leading projects, and refining its detection accuracy. |
| ![Stellar Community Fund](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/blob/main/docs/static/img/stellar.png) | We added support for Stellar's smart contract language, Soroban. We included various output formats, such as an HTML report, improved the tool's precision and recall, and added a GitHub action to run the tool with pull requests.|
