# Assert violation

## Description 

- Category: `Validations and error handling`
- Severity: `Enhancement`
- Detector: [`assert-violation`](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/detectors/assert-violation)
- Test Cases: [`assert-violation-1`](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases/assert-violation/assert-violation-1) 

The `assert!` macro is used in Rust to ensure that a certain condition holds true at a certain point in your code. 

## Why is it bad?

The `assert!` macro can cause the contract to panic.


## Issue example

Consider the following `Soroban` contract:

```rust
    pub fn assert_if_greater_than_10(_env: Env, value: u128) -> bool {
        assert!(value <= 10, "value should be less than 10");
        true
    }
```

The problem arises from the use of the `assert!` macro, if the condition is not met, the contract panics.

The code example can be found [here](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases/assert-violation/assert-violation-1/vulnerable-example).

## Remediated example

Avoid the use of `assert!` macro. Instead, use a proper error and return it.

```rust
    pub fn assert_if_greater_than_10(_env: Env, value: u128) -> Result<bool, AVError> {
        if value <= 10 {
            Ok(true)
        } else {
            Err(AVError::GreaterThan10)
        }
    }
```

The remediated code example can be found [here](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases/assert-violation/assert-violation-1/remediated-example).

## How is it detected?

Checks for `assert!` macro usage.
