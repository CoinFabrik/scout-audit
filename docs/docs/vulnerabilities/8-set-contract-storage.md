# Set contract storage

## Description
- Vulnerability Category: `Authorization`
- Severity: `Critical`
- Detectors: [`set-contract-storage`](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/detectors/set-contract-storage)
- Test Cases: [`set-contract-storage-1`](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases/set-contract-storage/set-contract-storage-1)[`set-contract-storage-2`](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases/set-contract-storage/set-contract-storage-2)[`set-contract-storage-3`](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases/set-contract-storage/set-contract-storage-3)

Smart contract can store important information in memory which changes 
through the contract's lifecycle. Changes happen via user interaction with 
the smart contract. An _unauthorized set contract storage_ vulnerability 
happens when a smart contract call allows a user to set or modify contract 
memory when he was not supposed to be authorized.

## Exploit Scenario
In this example we see that any user may access the 
`SetContractStorage()` function, and therefore modify the value of the internal counter.

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl SetContractStorage {
    /// Increment an internal counter; return the new value.
    pub fn increment(env: Env, user: Address) -> u32 {
        let storage = env.storage().instance();
        let mut count: u32 = storage.get(&user).unwrap_or_default();
        count += 1;
        storage.set(&user, &count);
        storage.extend_ttl(100, 100);
        count
    }
}
```

The vulnerable code example can be found [here](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases/set-contract-storage/set-contract-storage-1/vulnerable-example).

## Remediation
Arbitrary users should not have control over keys because it implies writing 
any value of a mapping, lazy variable, or the main struct of the contract 
located in position 0 of the storage. 
To prevent this issue, set access control and proper authorization validation 
for the `SetContractStorage()` function. 

For example, the code below, ensures only the authorized users can call 
`SetContractStorage()`.

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl SetContractStorage {
    /// Increment an internal counter; return the new value.
    pub fn increment(env: Env, user: Address) -> u32 {
        user.require_auth();
        let storage = env.storage().instance();
        let mut count: u32 = storage.get(&user).unwrap_or_default();
        count += 1;
        storage.set(&user, &count);
        storage.extend_ttl(100, 100);
        count
    }
}
```
