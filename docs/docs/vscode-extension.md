# Scout VS Code Extension

Add Scout to your development workspace with Scout's VS Code extension and run Scout automatically upon saving your file.

:warning: To ensure the extension runs properly, make sure that you open the directory containing your smart contract, rather than the entire project. For example, if your smart contracts are located in `myproject/contracts`, and you want to work on the `token` contract while using the Scout VS Code Extension, open `myproject/contracts/token`.

:bulb: Tip: To see the errors highlighted in your code, we recommend installing the [Error Lens Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens).

:point_right: Download Scout VS Code from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoinFabrik.scout-audit).
